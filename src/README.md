Hi!
My name is Maxim Tsvetkov this is my React project.

In this project I created Business Cards web site.
You can visit the website and watch all the Cards, see their info and location and etc.

**Few details:
1. Admin info :
email: 1@1.com
password: mt1

2. you can add image url to your account and it wil lbe displayed in the settings (top left in the navbar)

3. full admin control (SandBox). Admin can delete users and edit them. 

4. Dark mode option in the Navbar

**Few details about users:
- Regular user (not business) can register and log in to the web site - and this option gives him the opportunity to save this favorite cards.

- Business user has the regular user ability, and he also can add/edit/delete his cards.

- Admin has Business user abilities, but he can delete all cards in the site and also he has SandBox option: he can see there the registered users in the website, and have an option to edit/delete users.

Hope you will like my project, any comments on the project would be wonderful ðŸ˜Š
